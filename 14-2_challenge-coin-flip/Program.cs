/*
  Conditional operator challenge
  In this challenge, you'll implement a conditional operator to simulate a "coin flip". The resulting decision logic will display either heads or tails.

  - Use the Random class to generate a value.
  - Consider the range of numbers that is required.
  - Based on the value generated, use the conditional operator to display either heads or    tails.
  - There should be a 50% chance that the result is either heads or tails.
  - Your code should be easy to read, but with as few lines as possible.
  - You should be able to accomplish the desired result in three lines of code.

Random coinFlip = new Random();
int coinFlipResult = coinFlip.Next(1, 3);
Console.WriteLine($"Coin flip: {(coinFlipResult == 1 ? "Heads" : "Tails")}");
